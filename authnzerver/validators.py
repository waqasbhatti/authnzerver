# Below we construct a large but non-exhaustive list of names which
# users probably should not be able to register with, due to various
# risks:

#   common addresses must be reserved.
#
# * For a site which creates subdomains from usernames, important
#   common hostnames/domain names must be reserved.
#
# * For a site which uses the username to generate a URL to the user's
#   profile, common well-known filenames must be reserved.
#
# etc., etc.
